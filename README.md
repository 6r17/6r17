Hi :wave: !

I'm a Python Programmer and some of my work has [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

- :anger: `MadTypes` contains a `Metaclass` that does runtime type-verification, and a function to generate `json-schema` from annotations. 
- :robot: `MadFrame` is a programmable state-machine that allows event-driven programming.
