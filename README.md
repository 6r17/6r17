Hi :wave: !

I'm looking to help you if you are building a serverless pwa or a intersted in building a decentralized app in a web3 environement,

I'm a Python Programmer and some of my work has [MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

- :anger: [`MadTypes`](https://github.com/6r17/madtypes) contains a `Metaclass` that does runtime type-verification, and a function to generate `json-schema` from annotations. 
- :robot: [`MadFrame`](https://github.com/6r17/madframe) is a programmable asynchronous state-machine with an event-driven design.
